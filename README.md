# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

In this challenge I am trying to use sql and sequelize in tandem to make an ecommerce
application. I have to rout api's and properly use seeds along with various other js
files. This is a backend application.

In order to use this, you have to launch this on a local host and use insomnia in order
to make requests and get info in the database.

I have tried debugging this code for a few hours now. I believe all of my code is functional,
however it is saying something is wrong with my password whn I try to launch the local host.
I cannot seem to get this to work and accept my sql password. I hope th code is good enough.
